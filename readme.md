This repository includes projects done in ITE3073 class at Hanyang University in Spring 2018.

<br>

### Project1 - Sort algorithms
The goal was to implement sorting algorithms you learned. Implemented mergeSort, heapSort function.

<br>

### Project2 - Sort algorithms2
The goal was to implement sorting algorithms you learned. Implemented quickSort and countSort function


<br>

### Project3 - Hash Table
The goal was to implement a hash table in two ways you learned from the lecture.

1. First, implemented a simple hash table with linear probing.
2. Second, implemented another hash table with worst time search cost is O(1).

Then, described my implementation and evaluated the performance by measuring execution time.

<br>

### Project4 - Huffman Code
The goal of this project wass to implement two functions which process encoding and decoding by Huffman coding algorithm and compare the efficiency of compression.
